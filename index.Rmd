# This Hub

Purpose of this group:

1. Meet online once a quarter on topic of interest? Interest in more frequent meetings to ask questions/share concerns?

2. Share information/ask questions using the listserv

3. Share resources via the Google Doc

4. Once a year larger meeting to share info with a larger group from POWER?

5. Any other ideas?

## The Role of Human Fallibility in Psychological Research: A Survey of Mistakes in Data Management

# Methods

+ Contacted 16,412 researchers who published between 2010 and 2018 in a psychology journal. 779 responded, and 488 responses were kept in the sample.

--

+ A Qualtrics questionnaire was used to collect information regarding data management mistakes in their research team over the last 5 years.

--

1. How frequently they think any type of data management mistake happens? (very low to very high frequency)

2. What is the most frequent data management mistake? What is the most serious data management mistake? As well as the details of each:
  - cause (open text)
  - frequency (very low to very high frequency) - only asked for most frequent data mgmt mistake
  - seriousness (insignificant to extreme severity)
  - negative outcome (select one from a list of outcomes, or "other" with write in option)
  
---

# Methods

At the beginning of the survey, the authors provided examples of what they meant by data management mistakes

+ We had a software error in the experimental program where old answers were overwritten by new answers

+ We only realized after a week that we had been working on the wrong version of a dataset

+ When we moved data between spreadsheet we only partially selected the data which led to data loss

+ We mixed up the default level of a categorical variable

+ We used uninformative variable names that made it hard to re-use the dataset

# Procedures

.pull-left[
```{r fig.align="center", echo=FALSE ,out.width='75%', out.height= '75%'}

knitr::include_graphics("https://journals.sagepub.com/na101/home/literatum/publisher/sage/journals/content/ampa/2021/ampa_4_4/25152459211045930/20211020/images/large/10.1177_25152459211045930-fig1.jpeg")

```

]

.pull-right[
Authors completed some pre-processing and grouping of ratings and free text inputs based on several criteria (more details in the paper)

# Findings

- 79% of respondents said mistakes occurred with very low or low frequency
- 75% said the most frequently occurring mistakes happened with very low or low frequency

<br>

```{r fig.align="center", echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics("img/freq.png")

```

---

# Findings

- 68% of respondents said the most serious mistakes led to moderate, major or extreme consequences
- 69% said the most frequent mistakes led to only insignificant or minor consequences

<br>

```{r fig.align="center", echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics("img/serious.png")

```

# Findings

```{r fig.align="center", echo=FALSE, out.width = '70%', out.height= '70%'}

knitr::include_graphics("https://journals.sagepub.com/na101/home/literatum/publisher/sage/journals/content/ampa/2021/ampa_4_4/25152459211045930/20211020/images/large/10.1177_25152459211045930-table7.jpeg")

```

---

# Findings

- Most mistakes belonged in the data processing, data collection, and data sharing

```{r fig.align="center", echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%', out.height= '80%'}

knitr::include_graphics("https://journals.sagepub.com/na101/home/literatum/publisher/sage/journals/content/ampa/2021/ampa_4_4/25152459211045930/20211020/images/large/10.1177_25152459211045930-fig6.jpeg")

```

---

# Findings

- Causes of the most frequent errors varied depending on the error, with the most frequent cause being poor project preparation/management (43%) followed by personal difficulties (29%)

```{r fig.align="center", echo=FALSE ,out.width='75%', out.height= '55%'}

knitr::include_graphics("https://journals.sagepub.com/na101/home/literatum/publisher/sage/journals/content/ampa/2021/ampa_4_4/25152459211045930/20211020/images/large/10.1177_25152459211045930-fig4.jpeg")

```

---

# Findings

- For the most serious mistakes, the most common causes were also poor project preparation (39%) and personal difficulties (37%)

- Notice lack of knowledge is not insignificant though

```{r fig.align="center", echo=FALSE ,out.width='75%', out.height= '55%'}

knitr::include_graphics("img/serious_cause.png")

```


---

# Findings

- For the most frequent mistakes, the most common consequence by far was time loss (67%)

```{r fig.align="center", echo=FALSE ,out.width='75%', out.height= '55%'}

knitr::include_graphics("https://journals.sagepub.com/na101/home/literatum/publisher/sage/journals/content/ampa/2021/ampa_4_4/25152459211045930/20211020/images/large/10.1177_25152459211045930-fig5.jpeg")

```



---

# Findings

- For the most serious mistakes, consequences varied much more, but still mostly time loss (46%) and frustration (26%)

- Notice the percentages of erroneous conclusions though

```{r fig.align="center", echo=FALSE ,out.width='75%', out.height= '55%'}

knitr::include_graphics("img/serious_mistake.png")

```

---

# Solutions

- Generally some solutions that are mentioned include:

  + Working with librarians trained in research data management
  
  + Developing more formal training in data management
  
  + Implement guidelines and checklists in your lab to help adopt a more transparent workflow
  
  + Using dedicated software tools that make data management more transparent and less error prone

# Solutions

```{r fig.align="center", echo=FALSE}

```

---

# Next steps

Authors suggest the following next research questions:

1. What practices do researchers use to improve efficiency and quality control in data management?

2. What prevents researchers from using existing solutions? 
3. What is needed to increase adoption of these solutions?
